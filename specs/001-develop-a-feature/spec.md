# Feature Specification: Multi-Tenant Project-Based Session Management

**Feature Branch**: `001-develop-a-feature`
**Created**: 2025-09-14
**Updated**: 2025-09-17
**Status**: In sync with current implementation
**Input**: User description: "develop a feature on top of Ambient Code with current capabilties outlined here @components/capabilities.md. Right now all sessions are visible to all users. A user should be able to select a project for a session to run in. projects are private to the user, but could also be shared amoung other users or groups. In addition, users or groups of users could also be given access to limited settings aviable for a session. For example, user A may be able to run the session in a larger model while user B may be only given access to a smaller model. I beleive each user should be able to run the sessions they have access to view. anyone in the project has full ownership of the session regaless of who created it. sessions can be cloned to other projects. sessions can be set as locked on creation so that no further edits are made after creation. Sessions can also be created and started by bot accounts. For example certain actions in jira may trigger a session to run on the behave of the user as a bot account in a predefined project."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user of the Ambient Code platform, I want to organize my automated sessions into projects with controlled access and permissions, so that I can collaborate with specific teams while maintaining privacy and resource control for my work. Additionally, as a system administrator, I want to run automated sessions in projects without user access for system maintenance and background processing tasks.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user is authenticated, **When** they create a new session, **Then** they must target an Ambient-managed OpenShift project and associate the session with it via path `/api/projects/{project}/agentic-sessions`.
2. **Given** a project exists, **When** group access is configured via RoleBindings (admin/edit/view) using the groups API, **Then** members gain access consistent with that role.
3. **Given** a project exists, **When** an automated system uses a project access key (ServiceAccount token), **Then** it can create sessions within that project via the standard session API.
4. **Given** multiple users have project access, **When** any user creates or updates a session, **Then** project members have access consistent with their role.
5. **Given** a user has access to a session, **When** they attempt to run/stop it, **Then** the action succeeds subject to cluster/project limits.
6. **Given** a user has access to source and destination projects, **When** they clone a session, **Then** the session is copied to the destination project.

### Edge Cases
- How does the system handle OpenShift project template modifications after projects are created?
- How does the system handle session naming conflicts within a project?
- What happens when multiple users try to start/stop the same session simultaneously?
- How does the system handle partial failures during session cloning (e.g., metadata copied but session creation fails)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to select existing OpenShift projects as containers for sessions.
- **FR-002**: Projects CAN exist without any user access (e.g., for automated/system sessions).
- **FR-003**: OpenShift projects CAN be shared with specific users or groups via standard RBAC.
- **FR-004**: Users MUST be able to select a project when creating a new session.
- **FR-005**: All users with project access MUST have permissions for sessions within that project consistent with their role (admin/edit/view).
- **FR-006**: Users MUST only be able to view and run sessions in projects they have access to.
- **FR-007**: System MUST support cloning sessions from one project to another (when user has access to both).
- **FR-008**: System MUST support updating session configuration via PUT endpoint; immutability/locking is not enforced in the current version.
- **FR-009**: System MUST support project-scoped access checks via `GET /api/projects/{project}/access`.
- **FR-010**: System MUST support project group access management via `GET/POST/DELETE /api/projects/{project}/groups` using RoleBindings to cluster roles `ambient-project-{admin|edit|view}`.
- **FR-011**: System MUST support project access keys via `GET/POST/DELETE /api/projects/{project}/keys` that issue ServiceAccount tokens for automation.
- **FR-012**: User-facing services MUST be placed behind OAuth/ingress proxy or provided a forwarded user token; backend authorizes via Kubernetes RBAC.
- **FR-013**: Each project MUST be labeled `ambient-code.io/managed=true` to be considered an Ambient project.
- **FR-014**: Platform SHOULD auto-create a ProjectSettings CR in labeled namespaces for operator use; it is not exposed via REST endpoints.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **OpenShift Project**: Native OpenShift project/namespace that serves as the container for sessions.
- **AgenticSession**: Automated task configuration deployed as Custom Resource (v1alpha1) within a project namespace.
- **ProjectSettings (internal)**: Operator-managed configuration CRD auto-created in Ambient-labeled namespaces; not user-facing via REST.
- **User**: OpenShift user identity, granted access to projects via standard RBAC.
- **Group**: OpenShift group identity from existing identity provider, granted access via standard RBAC.
- **ServiceAccount / Access Key**: ServiceAccount and issued token used for automation and API access.
