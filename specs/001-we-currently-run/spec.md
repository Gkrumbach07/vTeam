# Feature Specification: Multi-Tenant Agentic Platform with External Tool Integration

**Feature Branch**: `001-we-currently-run`
**Created**: 2025-09-14
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "We currently run in one Kubernetes namespace with no namespace isolation. We have a custom CRD and an Operator that reconcile sessions into workloads. We have a simple Backend and Frontend but no OAuth and no API gateway. External tools like Jira, Slack, and GitHub are not yet first-class entry points; most interaction is manual or via the Frontend. I want to design a platform where external tools and an optional web UI can trigger and manage agentic sessions that execute in Kubernetes. Sessions are the primary concept: each session is a durable, append-only history/ledger with pointers to artifacts and logs. Namespaces provide isolation and ownership: sessions and workloads should live in project/team namespaces by default, with user namespaces optional for experiments. Two interaction modes are supported: zero-touch, where users stay inside Jira/Slack/GitHub and signed events create or advance sessions in the correct namespace without platform login; and full login, where users sign into the UI to view status/logs and request actions with namespace-scoped visibility. Access is namespace-based: users only see sessions where they have rights, either as viewers or editors, but end users never directly mutate session specs; only the backend does. Each namespace has policies that constrain models, tools, budgets, external calls, and approvals. The backend manages sessions declaratively while the Operator executes workloads, updates status, and leaves an audit trail with artifacts scoped to the namespace. Security posture is that all inbound events are cryptographically verified, namespace is resolved server-side from policy not from clients, RBAC fences visibility and actions, and session history is append-only. The goal is safe multi-tenancy with clear separation of projects on one cluster, strong namespace isolation, and discoverable artifacts. Success looks like most people being able to work entirely from Jira/Slack/GitHub, while power users can log into the UI; sessions land in the right namespace with the right policy; collaboration is clear via owners, viewers, and editors; the system scales across many projects; and every action is auditable with immutable history."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A development team wants to automate their workflow by triggering AI-powered agentic sessions directly from their existing tools (Jira tickets, Slack messages, GitHub events) without needing to leave those environments or manually access a separate platform. The sessions should automatically execute in an isolated environment that respects team boundaries, policy constraints, and access permissions, while maintaining a complete audit trail of all actions and artifacts.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** any external tool sends a webhook with specific trigger conditions, **When** the authenticated webhook is received, **Then** an agentic session is automatically created in the appropriate team namespace with proper policy constraints applied
2. **Given** a user has viewer access to a project namespace, **When** they access the web UI, **Then** they can see session status and logs for sessions in that namespace but cannot modify session specifications
3. **Given** an agentic session is running in a team namespace, **When** it generates artifacts or logs, **Then** these are automatically stored with namespace-scoped access and linked to the session's append-only history
4. **Given** a webhook from any external source triggers a session creation request, **When** the system processes the authenticated event, **Then** the appropriate namespace is resolved server-side based on policy, not client input
5. **Given** a user with editor permissions wants to initiate a session, **When** they use the web UI, **Then** they can request actions but the backend manages the actual session specification mutations

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a webhook authentication fails?
- How does the system handle namespace policy violations (budget exceeded, unauthorized model requested)?
- What occurs when a session tries to access resources outside its namespace scope?
- How are conflicts resolved when multiple external tools simultaneously trigger sessions for the same project?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide namespace-based isolation where sessions and workloads are contained within project/team namespaces
- **FR-002**: System MUST support zero-touch interaction mode allowing users or bot accounts to trigger sessions via webhooks from any external tool without platform login
- **FR-003**: System MUST support full login interaction mode providing web UI access to view session status, logs, and request actions
- **FR-004**: System MUST authenticate all inbound webhook events from external tools before processing
- **FR-005**: System MUST resolve target namespace server-side based on policy, never trusting client-provided namespace information
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain sessions as durable, append-only history/ledgers with generic artifact references that can accommodate different agentic frameworks
- **FR-007**: System MUST enforce namespace policies that constrain models, tools, budgets, external calls, and approvals
- **FR-008**: System MUST implement role-based access control with viewer and editor permissions scoped to namespaces
- **FR-009**: System MUST prevent end users from directly mutating session specifications, allowing only backend modifications
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide audit trail functionality with immutable history for all actions and decisions
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide a generic CRD that can tie together artifacts from different agentic frameworks while maintaining namespace-scoped access
- **FR-012**: System MUST support optional user namespaces for experimental work alongside default project/team namespaces
- **FR-013**: System MUST authenticate and authorize users via [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: OAuth provider not specified - corporate SSO, GitHub OAuth, custom identity provider?]
- **FR-014**: System MUST define retention policies for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: session history, artifacts, and logs retention period not specified]
- **FR-015**: System MUST handle session execution failures and provide [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: error notification mechanism not specified - email, Slack, UI notifications?]
- **FR-016**: System MUST scale to support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: target number of concurrent sessions, namespaces, and users not specified]
- **FR-017**: System MUST provide [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: policy configuration mechanism not specified - admin UI, YAML files, API, or configuration management system?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Session**: A generic CRD representing a durable execution unit with append-only history, framework-agnostic artifact references, logs, and status tracking, scoped to a specific namespace
- **Namespace**: An isolation boundary that contains sessions, workloads, policies, and access controls, typically representing projects or teams
- **Policy**: A set of constraints defining allowed models, tools, budget limits, external call permissions, and approval requirements for a namespace
- **User**: An authenticated entity with role-based permissions (viewer/editor) scoped to one or more namespaces
- **Artifact**: Output files, data, or resources generated by sessions from various agentic frameworks, with framework-specific storage mechanisms unified through generic session references
- **External Event**: Authenticated incoming webhook requests from any external tool that can trigger session operations, sent either by users or bot accounts
- **Audit Record**: Immutable log entry capturing all actions, decisions, and state changes with timestamps and attribution
